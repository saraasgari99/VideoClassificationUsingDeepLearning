# VideoClassificationUsingDeepLearning

In this project, Alex Lehner and I supervised by Professors Soni and Collins worked on automating morphological analysis of planarians by classifying their videos using a convolutional neural network and applying various machine learning techniques including transfer learning, regularization, and various data processing techniques to overcome class imbalance.
